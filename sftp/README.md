# SFTP Micro Service on Kubernetes 
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management over any reliable data stream.Compared to the SCP protocol, which only allows file transfers, the SFTP protocol allows for a range of operations on remote files which make it more like a remote file system protocol. An SFTP client's extra capabilities include resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal.
